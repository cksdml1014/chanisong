Education is another field that I value a lot as well as engineering and research, and therefore I've put much effort and consideration into it.  
I believe that education is one of the most powerful tools to influence the world and people.  
Also, it is one of the best way to use my talent and to share knowledge, to lead others to live better lives, and to make a more equal and sharing society.  
One of my biggest reason to pursue PhD course is to gain enough experience and knowledge with others, to learn others how to study and research, and therefore getting enough skills to become a professor, which I can contribute to many students a lot.  
My devotion into education has persisted throughout my schooldays, and I had participated in some significan events that I learnt how to convey my knowledge and experience to others, and find out I have a strong talent in this area.  
These are some of the events that influenced me a lot to grow ability as a educator.  

## Gong Dream Camp

- Gong Dream camp is a 4-day mentroing camp for 120 high school students with 30 mentors from SENS participating.
- SENS(Society of Engineering Network and Service) is a Engineering Education volunteer club of SNU College of Engineering
- With other members of SENS, I hosted Gong Dream Camp 2 times.
- I planned and operated startup contest for mentees, along with taking charge of 9 group mentees to control throughout the camp, and give personal consultation about their worries about schoolworks and future plans.
- I've also assisted other programs that nurture the mentees dreams as becoming an engineer, such as E-Contest which is building specific machine with limited resources, or introducing each specific major of engineering for them to know what can you learn at college and determine where to apply.
- I gained so much love and thanks from the mentees throughout the camp, also with giving much care and love for them.
- After the camp, I am keeping in touch with my mentees, giving them advice for study and hanging out time by time.

## SENS

- Besides 2 times of Gong Dream Camp, I've done various mentoring volunteering with SENS members, summing up to 87.5 hours of volunteer work.
- I've took the executive roles twice, one for taking the charge of Daily Engineering Class chair and once as a vice-president role.
- While working as a Daily Engineering Class chair, I've developed a new program for the class called 'Principle of viscoelasticity' with using potato starch slurry for students to experiment with, which is still using in SENS for 7 year now.
- Through Daily Engineering Class program, I could introduce engineering to middle school students, with programs like 'Principle of viscoelasticity', 'Glider folding contest', and 'building spaghetti and marshmellow tower' and convey the importance of efficiency and safety in engineering. I could also give campus tours to the mentees and give study advice, along with growing their dreams of becoming an engineer.
- Through Engineering Talk Tal program, I introduced my major: mechanical engineering to high school students. Thining about the periods that I suffered due to lack of information about the different majors of engineering, I tried to convey information as easy and helpful as possible. The major courses, what do they teach, and what kinds of engineering field and jobs you can take.
- Working as an executive, I could give opinions about how to revise the programs to make more efficient mentoring, and how to make other students more enthusiastic into mentoring programs. Participating in the executive meeting bi-weekly, I could make good friends that has strong interest with engineering education and make good friends with them, which still gives me a lot of insights.

## Major Snapshot

- Activities from SENS had gave me great opportunites to give mentoring and love to mentees, which brought me so much happiness in the fact that I could be a great help for them. Especially, introducing each majors to high school students seemed so cruical for students, as I didn't have enough information about it when I was their age. But with SENS activities, I could only convey information and contribute to the students that I could meet face to face. There were a lot of other students that still need those information and I tried to wonder what else I can do for them.
- After I joined STEM, which is SNU Engineers Honor Society, I could post articles to [STEMentor](https://stementor.tistory.com/), which is a website used to post informative articles about engineering by STEM members. STEMentor is a huge website with total of more than 1.6 million views, and I found this as a great chance to convey information to other students that I can't reach offline.
- When I became the executive of STEM, I came out with a program of writing 'Major Snapshot' in STEMentor where members of STEM can convey information of the major courses they take, in the level that high school students can understand.
- With encouraging memebers of STEM to write Major Snapshots, I could also write 3 articles introducing 4 major mechanics, robotics, and mechanics and design which I regarded as crucial courses of mechanical engineering.
- As this date of August 12th of 2024, there are 106 Major Snapshots uploaded in STEMentor from various majors of engineering, and many high school students can now refer to these articles when they are curious what can they learn in college.
- Especially one of my article: Introducing 4 major mechanics had biggest hit, marking the highest view of the major snapshot with 10000 views.
- With it's peak, even the Google search engine refered to my article when you search '4대역학' in Google, which means 4 major mechanics in Korean. It illustrated 4 major mechanics as Solid mechanics, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, and Dynamics as I wrote in the article, which is different from 4 major mechanics from Physics. It is still listed on top of the search result from Google.
- You can connect to my 3 articles with the following links, all written in Korean.

- Until this day after I graduated STEM as an Honor member, I still give feedback to newly updated major snapshots to make them more understandable to high school students.
