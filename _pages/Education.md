Education is another field that I value a lot as well as engineering and research, and therefore I've put much effort and consideration into it.  
I believe that education is one of the most powerful tools to influence the world and people.  
Also, it is one of the best way to use my talent and to share knowledge, to lead others to live better lives, and to make a more equal and sharing society.  
One of my biggest reason to pursue PhD course is to gain enough experience and knowledge with others, to learn others how to study and research, and therefore getting enough skills to become a professor, which I can contribute to many students a lot.  
My devotion into education has persisted throughout my schooldays, and I had participated in some significan events that I learnt how to convey my knowledge and experience to others, and find out I have a strong talent in this area.  
These are some of the events that influenced me a lot to grow ability as a educator.
