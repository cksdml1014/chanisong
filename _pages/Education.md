Education is another field that I value a lot as well as engineering and research, and therefore I've put much effort and consideration into it.  
I believe that education is one of the most powerful tools to influence the world and people.  
Also, it is one of the best way to use my talent and to share knowledge, to lead others to live better lives, and to make a more equal and sharing society.  
One of my biggest reason to pursue PhD course is to gain enough experience and knowledge with others, to learn others how to study and research, and therefore getting enough skills to become a professor, which I can contribute to many students a lot.  
My devotion into education has persisted throughout my schooldays, and I had participated in some significan events that I learnt how to convey my knowledge and experience to others, and find out I have a strong talent in this area.  
These are some of the events that influenced me a lot to grow ability as a educator.  

## Gong Dream Camp

- Gong Dream camp is a 4-day mentroing camp for 120 high school students with 30 mentors from SENS participating.
- SENS(Society of Engineering Network and Service) is a Engineering Education volunteer club of SNU College of Engineering
- With other members of SENS, I hosted Gong Dream Camp 2 times.
- I planned and operated startup contest for mentees, along with taking charge of 9 group mentees to control throughout the camp, and give personal consultation about their worries about schoolworks and future plans.
- I've also assisted other programs that nurture the mentees dreams as becoming an engineer, such as E-Contest which is building specific machine with limited resources, or introducing each specific major of engineering for them to know what can you learn at college and determine where to apply.
- I gained so much love from the mentees throughout the camp, also with giving much care and love for them.
