</div>

Mechanism Design Automation leverages innovative modeling frameworks, specifically **SBM (Spring-connected Block Model)** and **JBM (Joint-element Block Model)**, to streamline the design and synthesis of linkage mechanisms. These models enable the automatic design of mechanisms capable of performing complex tasks that traditionally rely on manual, heuristic-based approaches.

### What are SBM and JBM?

- **SBM (Spring-connected Block Model)**: SBM utilizes spring connections between rigid blocks to represent mechanical systems. The flexibility of this model allows it to handle both linear and nonlinear behaviors, making it ideal for simulating dynamic systems and designing mechanisms with complex motion paths.
  
- **JBM (Joint-element Block Model)**: JBM builds on the SBM concept by incorporating joint elements between the blocks, allowing for more intricate and precise motion control. This makes it suitable for designing systems with high degrees of freedom and specific motion constraints.

Both models are capable of synthesizing mechanisms that would be challenging or impossible to achieve through conventional manual design processes. This includes optimizing linkages for tasks such as path-following, obstacle avoidance, and movement in constrained environments (while respecting NDA-protected applications).

## Publications & Manuscripts

### Synthesizing Mechanisms Using SBM

1. **C. Song†**, J. Kim, and Y.Y. Kim∗, *“Automatic Synthesis of 1-DOF Linkage Mechanism Using SBM (applied in a special environment: Details to be disclosed upon acceptance)”*, expected submission in 2024 to *Journal of Mechanical Design*.

   - **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel synthesis method for linkage mechanisms using the SBM framework. The focus is on automating the design process and enhancing the performance of linkage systems in complex environments. Detailed descriptions of the target problems and the impact of this research will be disclosed after the journal acceptance. The originality of this research lies heavily in the problem definition, so disclosing it prematurely through a public website might jeopardize the research’s uniqueness. However, the problem definition, methods, results, and potential impact can be shared via private Zoom meetings.
   
   - **Expected Impact**: This research is crucial for the automatic design of linkage mechanisms in specialized environments, particularly in robotics. Although the specifics cannot be disclosed online at this time, the work represents significant advancements in mechanism design for complex environments.

### Designing Novel Mechanisms Using JBM

2. **C. Song†**, J. Kim, and Y.Y. Kim∗, *“A Novel Mechanism Synthesized Using the 3D JBM Model and Topology Optimization”*, expected submission in 2025 to *Mechanism and Machine Theory*.

   - **Summary**: This paper presents the design and synthesis of novel mechanical systems using a new 3D design method. The methodology for the automatic synthesis of 3D linkage mechanisms is highly developed, though submission is delayed until 2025 due to project requirements and a contract with Hyundai Motors.

   - **NDA Compliance**: This project, conducted in collaboration with Hyundai Motors, involves designing a novel mechanism for use in their next-generation high-performance hydrogen-hybrid concept car. Due to NDA restrictions, specific details about the mechanism's application and results cannot be publicly disclosed. However, more information, including the synthesis process of mechanisms that follow a desired path in a 3D environment, can be shared through private Zoom meetings.
  
   - **Expected Impact**: The development of a 3D automatic synthesis methodology marks a significant advancement in the field of automatic linkage synthesis technology, overcoming the limitations of previous methodologies confined to 2D spaces. This approach has wide applications, including in vehicles, exoskeletons, medical robotics, and locomotion robots, among others.

### Future Directions & Zoom Meetings

Due to the sensitive nature of my ongoing research projects, I am available for private discussions via **Zoom meetings** to provide more detailed information. During these meetings, I can share additional research materials and synthesized videos that are under NDA. It is recommended that these meetings be recorded for reference when I introduce my research processes and results. Please feel free to contact me to schedule a discussion.
