My publications & manuscripts focus on Mechanism Design Automation Technology, which was first proposed and developed by SNU's IDeALab using SBM(Spring connected rigid Block Model) and JBM (Joint-element connected rigid
Block Model)
From IDeAOcean, I've made huge contributions to developing Mechanism Design Automation technology and preparing multiple journals.
Also using this technology, I've designed novel and practical mechanisms applicable to the rear wing, sliding door, hood hinge, etc, along with cooperating with Hyundai Motors.
