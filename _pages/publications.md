</div>

Mechanism Design Automation leverages innovative modeling frameworks, specifically **SBM (Spring-connected Block Model)** and **JBM (Joint-element Block Model)**, to streamline the design and synthesis of linkage mechanisms. These models enable the automatic design of mechanisms that can perform complex tasks traditionally reliant on manual, heuristic-based approaches.

### What is SBM and JBM?

- **SBM (Spring-connected Block Model)**: SBM utilizes spring connections between rigid blocks to represent mechanical systems. The flexibility of this model allows it to handle both linear and nonlinear behaviors, making it ideal for simulating dynamic systems and designing mechanisms with complex motion paths.
  
- **JBM (Joint-element Block Model)**: JBM builds on the SBM concept by incorporating joint elements between the blocks, allowing for more intricate and precise motion control. This makes it suitable for designing systems with high degrees of freedom and specific motion constraints.

Both models are capable of synthesizing mechanisms that would be challenging or impossible to achieve through conventional manual design processes. This includes optimizing linkages for tasks such as path-following, obstacle avoidance, and movement in constrained environments (without disclosing NDA-protected applications).

### Publications & Contributions

My work in Mechanism Design Automation has led to the development of new methods for synthesizing mechanical systems with high performance and adaptability. Although certain research is under NDA, my published work and manuscripts provide insight into the theoretical advancements achieved with SBM and JBM models.

## Publications & Manuscripts

### Synthesizing Mechanisms Using SBM

1. **C. Song†**, J. Kim, and Y.Y. Kim∗, *“Automatic Synthesis of 1-DOF Linkage Mechanism Using SBM (on a special environment: To be Disclosed)”*, expected submission in 2024 to *Journal of Mechanical Design*.

   - **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel synthesis method for linkage mechanisms using the SBM framework. The focus is on automating the design process and enhancing the performance of linkage systems in complex environments. The detailed target problems and impact of this research could be disclosed after getting accepted to the journal. This is because The problem definition is crucial to kepp this research's originality and it could be a problem if I disclose the problem definition first through website. However, I can disclose much of this research, the problem definition, methods to solve it, and the results and impact via private zoom meeting.

   - **Expected Impact**: This research is crucial for automatic design of linkage mechanism in a special environment, especially designing mechanisms for robots, which the environment cannot be disclosed online for now.

### Designing Novel Mechanisms Using JBM

2. **C. Song†**, J. Kim, and Y.Y. Kim∗, *“A Novel Mechanism Synthesized Using 3D JBM Model and Topology Optimization”*, expected submission in 2025 to *Mechanism and Machine Theory*.

   - **Summary**: This paper presents the design and synthesis of novel mechanical systems using a novel 3D design method. Methodology of Automatic synthesis of 3D linkage Mechanisms is developed with high completeness for now, but the submission will be delayed until 2025 due to required process and contract with Hyndai Motors.

   - **NDA Compliance**: This project is part of a collaboration with Hyundai Motors, designing a novel mechanism which will be used in Hyundai's novel high-performance hydrogen-hybrid concept car. Due to NDAs, specific mechanism usage and results cannot be fully disclosed. However, more information could be disclosed via personal zoom meeting, including the process that this novel method synthesizes a mechanism following desired path in a 3D environment.
  
   - **Expected Impact**: Development of 3D automatic synthesis methodology with a reasonable time marks a great impact in the development of automatic linkage synthesis technology, since previouos methodology were only constrained in 2D spaces. This methodology enables synthesis of various mechanisms applicable to various fields, inclduing vehicle, exo-skeleton, medical robots, locomotive robots, etc.

### Future Directions & Zoom Meetings

Due to the sensitive nature of my current research projects, I am available for private discussions via **Zoom meetings** to provide more in-depth information. During these meetings, I can disclose additional research materials and synthesized videos that are under NDA, with a consent that the zoom meeting can be recorded when I introduce my research process and results. Please feel free to contact me to schedule a discussion.
