My publications & manuscripts focus on **Mechanism Design Automation Technology**, which was first proposed and developed by *SNU's IDeALab* using **SBM**(Spring connected rigid Block Model) and **JBM**(Joint-element connected rigid
Block Model)  
From IDeAOcean, I've made huge contributions to developing Mechanism Design Automation technology and preparing multiple journals.  
Also using this technology, I've designed novel and practical mechanisms applicable to the *rear wing*, *sliding door*, *hood hinge*, etc, along with cooperating with Hyundai Motors.  
More information about previous contributions of Mechanism Design Automation Technology can be found from **[here](https://ideaocean.ai/technology/)**

## Synthesizing mechanisms that avoid obstacles using SBM
1. **C. Song†**, J. Kim, and Y.Y. Kim∗, *“Automatic Synthesis of 1-DOF Linkage Mechanism in a Constrained Space”*, Expected
submission in 2024 at *Journal of Mechanical Design*.

## Synthesizing novel rear wing mechanism using newly developed 3D JBM model
2. **C. Song†**, J. Kim, J. Kim, J. Jang, Y. Han, E. Park and Y.Y. Kim∗, *“A Novel Rear-wing Mechanism Synthesized by a
Systematic Design Process Employing Topology Optimization”*, Expected submission in 2025 at *Mechanism and Machine
Theory*.

<small>
Manuscript submission is scheduled for 2025 due to Hyundai Motors’ project completion and internal conference schedule.
Currently, it is difficult to disclose the research results due to the project agreement regulations, as the research is being conducted in the form of a corporate project with Hyundai Motors.
However, you can refer to the level of results that can be disclosed on the page below
