Welcome to my personal website!

I created this space to showcase my work and research, which reflect my qualifications as a prospective PhD candidate and my journey toward pursuing a doctoral degree.  
Here, you'll find a collection of my academic projects, publications, and other efforts that have shaped my path and aspirations in research.

### Background

My name is Chan-Eui Song, and I am currently completing a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering with a double major in Mathematics from Seoul National University (SNU).  
While I have fulfilled the requirements for graduation, I am currently on a break from my studies to work as a researcher at <a href="https://ideaocean.ai" style="color: #4a90e2; text-decoration: none;">IDeAOcean</a>—one of Korea's fastest-growing startups in mechanism and machine design, where I am a core founding member.

### Research Interests

- My research focuses on **Mechanism Design Automation Technology**, combining design and optimization to develop efficient, low-cost mechanisms.
- I am particularly interested in reducing degrees of freedom (DoF) for lighter, more mobile and affordable designs, with applications in robotics: focusing on legged/locomotion robots.
- My broader interests include control systems and AI-based optimal design, all of which intersect with optimization. Additionally, I have explored origami structures and aim to apply these principles to mechanism design in the future.
- A strong foundation in mathematics and mechanics, especially in optimization, drives my research approach.

### Future Goals

I plan to begin my PhD studies in 2025, focusing on advancing robot mechanism design and optimal design automation. My goal is to develop efficient mechanisms that reduce the complexity and cost of robotic systems, making them more accessible for widespread use over various environments.  

I aim to contribute to robotics by designing systems that improve mobility and reliability while integrating control systems and optimization for enhanced performance. These affordable robots have the potential to increase productivity, improve safety in dangerous tasks, and make advanced technology more accessible across various sectors.  

In the long term, I aspire to become a professor, combining teaching and research to mentor future engineers and continue advancing the field. My goal is to drive innovation and make a lasting impact through both academic work and real-world applications.
