Welcome to my website!

I'm Chan-Eui Song, a mechanical engineering student from SNU.

Since September 2023, I'm working as a researcher from IDeAOcean, a company developing state-of-art technology on mechanism and machine design.

I'm planning to pursue my PhD course starting from 2025, expecting to grow a lot through interaction with many talented researchers from around the world.

I'm a expert at mechanism design, but also love to study control / mechanics / robotics and other issues that may innovate the world.

I love math and mechanics, and I aim to make huge contribution to the society by both research and education.

I like to discuss about engineering issues from various fields, and I'll appreciate constructive conversation or contacts.

I'm also a huge football fan, supporting FC Seoul from when I was 4.

P.S. For non-Korean speakers finding hard to pronounce my name, you can call me Chani :)
