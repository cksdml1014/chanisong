Welcome to my personal website!

I created this space to showcase my work and research, which reflect both my qualifications as a prospective PhD candidate and my journey toward pursuing a doctoral degree. Here, you'll find a collection of my academic projects, publications, and other efforts that have shaped my path and aspirations in research.

My name is Chan-Eui Song, and I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a double major in Mathematics from Seoul National University (SNU). I have completed all my graduation requirements and, since September 2023, I have been working as a researcher at **[IDeAOcean](https://ideaocean.ai)**—an innovative company specializing in state-of-the-art technology for mechanism and machine design.

I plan to begin my PhD studies in 2025, and I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from esteemed researchers across the globe. My primary focus is mechanism design, but I’m equally passionate about control systems, optimization, robotics, and mechanics—areas that I believe hold great potential to drive meaningful innovation in our world.

I am deeply committed to mathematics and engineering, and I aspire to make a lasting contribution to society through research and education.

On this website, you can explore some of my key works:
- **Publications and Manuscripts:** This section features my research in Mechanism Design Automation Technology, supported by images and videos that offer deeper insights into my findings.
- **Projects and Research Results:** In this section, you'll find my work across diverse areas such as control systems, robotics, and origami structures. Many of these projects are the result of in-depth research and are supplemented with materials like data, designs, and visual aids that further illustrate my findings. Notable projects include METHEUS, which was recognized with a CES Innovation Award.
- **Key Courses:** This section highlights my academic achievements in key subject areas, showcasing the breadth of my studies.
- **Education:** Discover the diverse educational experiences that have shaped my passion for academia and my drive to become both a professor and a researcher.
- **STEM Activities:** Learn about my involvement in SNU's Honor Society STEM, where I collaborate with peers from various disciplines to foster creative problem-solving and research ideas.
- **Miscellaneous:** Here, you’ll find reflections on my time as an exchange student at RWTH Aachen University, where I embraced diverse cultural perspectives, and insights from my military service, which developed my leadership, discipline, and resilience.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I’m always eager to engage in thoughtful discussions on a wide range of engineering topics. I invite you to connect with me—whether to discuss my research or to share ideas from your own experiences.

P.S. If you find it difficult to pronounce my name, feel free to call me Chani!
