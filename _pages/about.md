Welcome to my website!

I'm Chan-Eui Song, a mechanical engineering & mathematics(double major) student from SNU.

I've fulfilled all the requirements for graduation, and since September 2023, I've been working as a researcher from **[IDeAOcean](https://ideaocean.ai)**, a company developing state-of-the-art technology on mechanism and machine design.

I'm planning to pursue my PhD course starting in 2025, expecting to grow a lot through interaction with many talented researchers from around the world.

I'm an expert at mechanism design, but I also love to study control / mechanics / robotics and other issues that may innovate the world.

I love math and mechanics, and I aim to make a huge contribution to society through research and education.

I like discussing engineering issues from various fields, and I'd appreciate constructive conversation or contact.

I'm also a huge football fan, supporting FC Seoul from when I was 4.

P.S. For non-Korean speakers finding it hard to pronounce my name, you can call me Chani :)
