Welcome to my website!

This website is made to display my works, which proves my abilities to be a PhD candidate, and which also shows my will and how I get to decide to challenge for being a phD. 

I'm Chan-Eui Song, a bachelor's student in mechanical engineering & mathematics(double major) from SNU.

I've fulfilled all the requirements for graduation. Since September 2023, I've been working as a researcher from **[IDeAOcean](https://ideaocean.ai)**, a company developing state-of-the-art technology on mechanism and machine design.

I'm planning to pursue my PhD course starting in 2025, expecting to grow a lot through interaction with many talented researchers from around the world.

I'm an expert at mechanism design, but I also love to study control / mechanics / robotics and other issues that may innovate the world.

I love math and mechanics, and I aim to make a huge contribution to society through research and education.

You can find my most notable research from "Publication and Manuscript", which contains my publications and manuscripts in my research in Mechanism Design Automation Technology with supportive images and videos to illustrate it in detail.

You can also find my other research in various areas including control, robotics and origami structures from "Projects", along with other notable projects including METHEUS which won CES Innovationi award.

From "Key Courses", you can find my academic accomplishment in key courses.

From "Education", you can find my strong will and devotion to education through various actvities, and the reason I want to be a professor and PhD.

From "STEM", you can find my activities in SNU's Honor Society STEM, where you can find how I like to communicate with people in different fields to gain motivation and insights to research.

In "Miscellaneous", you can see my periods in exchange student at RWTH Aachen University where I find my will and strength to study abroad, in a community where many cultural backgrounds meet.  
Also, you can find my periods in military, where I grew in various aspects including leadership, healthy mentality, reading, English, Mechanics.

I like discussing engineering issues from various fields, and I'd appreciate constructive conversation or contact.

I'm also a huge football fan, supporting FC Seoul from when I was 4.

P.S. For non-Korean speakers finding it hard to pronounce my name, you can call me Chani :)
