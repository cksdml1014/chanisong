    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: gray;"> METHEUS v1.0 (CES2024 Innovation Award)</p>
</div>

- METHEUS is an AI-driven mechanism design solution developed by *IDeAOcean*.  
- It was awarded the **CES 2024 Innovation Award** for its ability to autonomously generate mechanisms tailored to various needs.  
- I contributed by generating large-scale linkage datasets, which included essential information like the path of the effector, manipulability, and kineto-static analysis.  
- Since CES 2024, we’ve been working on METHEUS v2.0, with plans to release it in 2025.
