## Exchange Semester at RWTH Aachen University

In the Spring semester of 2023, I had the opportunity to study as an exchange student at RWTH Aachen University. This experience significantly impacted my career, not only in terms of academics and research but also by broadening my cultural understanding, improving my English proficiency, and giving me a taste of living abroad.

### Academic Experience

At RWTH Aachen, I took three master's-level courses: Nonlinear Control, Model-Based Estimation Methods, and Reinforcement Learning & Learning-Based Control. Due to differing academic schedules between Germany and Korea, I completed exams for the first two courses, achieving 1.0 in both. This boosted my confidence in my academic competitiveness, as earning such grades at a German institution is considered challenging. I was pleased to find that I could handle these courses with less effort than similar courses at SNU, which reassured me of my ability to thrive in international academic environments.

Through this experience, I gained clarity in my career direction. Through my studies, I recognized that while significant advancements have been made in both optimal and nonlinear control, these areas are highly developed and often theoretical. This led me to explore mechanism design, where I see more opportunities for innovation and practical applications. However, I remain deeply interested in control systems and how they can intersect with mechanical design to address complex engineering challenges.

### Research Experience

During my time at RWTH, I also had the chance to conduct research, applying Model Predictive Control (MPC) to an embedded system. This experience allowed me to present my research to foreign advisors, further developing my communication skills and gaining valuable feedback on my work.

### Cultural and Social Experience

In addition to my academic growth, my time at RWTH was a valuable cultural experience. I formed a close-knit group of international friends from Mexico, Austria, Turkey, Slovakia, and Ethiopia, and we met regularly at a local bar called *Kaktus* to share our experiences and cultures. We enjoyed activities like cooking traditional meals, going on day trips, and even introducing our families to one another. This deepened my understanding of different cultures and reinforced my belief that I can build strong, lasting friendships with people from diverse backgrounds, regardless of nationality or race.

I also took full advantage of events hosted by student associations such as AV, Incas, AEGEE, and TedX RWTH. These events allowed me to meet new friends from various backgrounds, some of whom I’ve maintained close relationships with.

### Travel and Broader Perspectives

Throughout my exchange semester, I traveled to 70 cities across 24 countries, meeting people from diverse backgrounds, including Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. These encounters broadened my perspective on different lifestyles and societal challenges. I focused much of my travels on the Balkans, where I found that travelers tend to be particularly open-minded and eager to connect. Meeting people from various walks of life has reinforced my belief that an engineer must understand the different needs and problems of people across cultures. I continue to keep in touch with many of the people I met, and they remain valuable connections that will enrich my career and personal growth.

### Personal Growth and Future Goals

This exchange semester reaffirmed my ability to adapt quickly to new environments, work alongside people from diverse backgrounds, and excel academically in a foreign language. These skills will be invaluable as I pursue a PhD abroad.

My experience in Germany also helped me realize the advantages of studying in regions like the U.S. or the EU, where there are abundant opportunities for collaboration between academia and industry. I saw that many students in Europe, particularly in Germany, gain practical experience through internships at prestigious companies, which complements the theoretical focus of their studies. In contrast, Korea excels in theoretical studies but offers fewer practical opportunities. Given my strong theoretical foundation, I believe that pursuing a PhD abroad, where I can gain more hands-on experience, is the next logical step in my career.

I documented my entire exchange experience in detail through Instagram, writing 510 daily posts over six months. This diary not only serves as a record of this pivotal time in my life but also as a source of reflection on how much I grew during this semester.


## ROKAF: Republic of Korea Air Force

From August 2019 to May 2021, I served my mandatory military service in the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF), completing 21.5 months of duty. Although this period posed a significant break from my engineering studies, I embraced it as a valuable opportunity for personal growth and development in several key areas.

### Leadership and Conflict Management

Military service introduced me to a strict hierarchical environment where I was required to both follow orders and lead others. As a senior soldier, I was responsible for mentoring and guiding junior soldiers through daily operations and drills. This experience was a pivotal opportunity to develop my leadership skills. Additionally, I often found myself mediating conflicts between my fellow soldiers, who were living in close quarters under stressful conditions. By listening carefully and maintaining objectivity, I was able to help resolve misunderstandings and foster better communication among the group. These leadership experiences have deeply influenced my approach to teamwork and will serve me well in future academic and professional environments.

### Adaptability and Resilience

Living with eight other soldiers in a confined space for nearly two years required me to quickly adapt to a new and challenging environment. Privacy was limited, and the day-to-day routine was rigorous. However, I developed resilience and the ability to thrive in uncomfortable situations. This adaptability proved especially useful during my exchange semester at RWTH Aachen University, where I had to adjust to a new culture and overcome various obstacles. I am confident that these experiences will continue to benefit me as I pursue my PhD in another unfamiliar environment.

### Intellectual Growth and Life Perspective

The restrictions on the use of electronic devices during my service gave me ample time to read and reflect. Throughout my service, I read 50 books, spanning a wide range of genres, though I particularly gravitated toward classic literature. I also wrote detailed reviews to capture the lessons and emotions each book provoked. This period of introspection helped broaden my perspective on life, teaching me to approach challenges with patience and resilience, to focus on personal growth rather than external comparisons, and to appreciate the importance of making a positive impact on the world. These reflections have significantly influenced my life philosophy and approach to both my academic and personal pursuits.

### English and Academic Improvement

During my time in the Air Force, I also dedicated myself to improving my English, which had taken a backseat during my university years due to my focus on engineering studies and educational activities. The progress I made in English during this period later proved invaluable during my role in organizing SRT (Student Round Table) and during my exchange semester at RWTH Aachen.

In addition to language study, I used this time to deepen my understanding of solid mechanics, a subject I had previously struggled with. This in-depth study gave me a much stronger grasp of mechanics, which became crucial when I returned to my university courses. The knowledge I gained during this time laid a solid foundation for my subsequent academic work in engineering.

### Mental Fortitude and Life Philosophy

My time in the military reinforced a mindset of resilience and purpose. I learned the importance of taking obstacles and failures in stride, setting meaningful life goals, and finding fulfillment in helping others. This period strengthened me mentally, teaching me to handle stress more effectively and live with a greater sense of gratitude. I emerged from the military with a renewed commitment to make the most of every opportunity and to approach life with both perseverance and optimism.
