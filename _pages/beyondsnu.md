## Exchange Semester at RWTH Aachen University

- **Period:** Spring 2023
- **Impact:** Broadened academic and cultural horizons, improved English proficiency, and experienced life abroad.
  
### Academic Experience
- **Courses:** Nonlinear Control, Model-Based Estimation, Reinforcement Learning & Learning-Based Control.
- Achieved 1.0 in Nonlinear Control and Model-Based Estimation, validating my academic competitiveness in Germany. Couldn't take exam of Reinforcement Learning & Learning-Based Control due to semester schedule back in SNU.
- Developed interest in practical applications of mechanism design, recognizing that control systems and mechanical design can intersect to solve complex problems.

### Research Experience
- **Project:** Applied Model Predictive Control (MPC) to an embedded system.
- Conducted research, formulated QP problems, and wrote control code during lab work.
- Gained valuable feedback from foreign advisors, enhancing communication and research presentation skills.
