## Exchange Semester at RWTH Aachen University

- I had my exchange semester in RWTH Aachen University for Spring semester in 2023.
- My exchange semester had great impact on my career, not only about the academic and research, but also about understanding different cultures, chances of living abroad, and making a great progress in using English.
- I took 3 master courses in RWTH, about nonlinear control, model based estimation methods, and reinforcement learning and learning based control which I could take exams of only the first two courses due to different semester schedule between Germany and Korea.
- I had no problem catching up with the courses, thereby getting confidence in studying engineering in a whole new environment with English. I could also gain confidence with my academic performance, especially mathematic-related performance by getting both 1.0 grade from two courses. As getting a 1.0 from a German institute is regarded difficult but since I didn't had to put much work compared to SNU courses, I found that I have strong academic competitiveness even in institutes abroad that has high reputation.
- Also this was a chance for me to determine to join *IDeAOcean*, since I thougth that optimal control has developed a lot and nonlinear control is now not yet very practical in many fields. I came up to think that focusing on mechanism can bring much innovation compared to control.
- I've also grab a chance to conduct a research in RWTH, trying MPC on a embedded system. It was a great chance to communicate and present my research status and research to foreign advisors.
- I've also tried to focus and devoted my efforts more on experiencing different cultures, making new friends, and practically using English. I tried in various ways to reach this goal.
- For one, I made a friend group of foreign students called *'FWL'* composed of students from Mexico, Austria, Turkiye, Slovakia, and Ethiophia. We gathered every Wendenesday in a bar called *'Kaktus'* to drink Kolsch, which was the local beer in the region. We've shared a lot of memories: like inviting parents and introducing to each other, going on picnic or day trip, cooking each home countries' food, etc. It was a great chance to deeply understand the different culture from different nations, understanding what is considered granted per each country, different work and study environment, and many others. Also I gained a lot of confidence that I could stay really close with friends regardless of their countries, races, and sexual orientation, since everyone had these different backgrounds. I've focused to stay an open mind throughout my exchange semester, which was important for me since I've stayed in Korean culture composed of mostly similar race and backgrounds, and I enjoyed meeting people from various backgrounds. I am pretty sure this experience would be critical when I get a chance to pursue phD degree abroad, especially in culture where I have to cooperate and work with people from various culture.
- Another effort was to participate in events hosted by student association as much as possible; as I can meet many new friends from different backgrounds from there. I checked and tried to participate as most of events run by AV, Incas, AEGEE, and TedX RWTH. I could make so many friends from those events, some lasted as a deep relationship.
- I've also aimed chance to make friends who have a total different background as me. I loved friends from Aachen, but they are normally college students studying engineering, which helps me a lot but which is a closed society in some sense. I took chance of travelling across the European cities, resulting in travelling 70 cities in 24 countries. Through travelling, I could meet many new people, mostly Europeans but also from various backgrounds like the US, Canada, Guatemalla, Brazil, Singapore, Austrailia, Chille, and aging from 13 to 60s. These people had so much different background and different lifestyles. I realized that it is more easy to meet open minded traveller and be friends with them in the Balkan areas, therefore focusing to plan my trips in the Balkans in the latter part of my exchange semester. As an engineer, I think it's important to realize that there are the different backgrounds of human, and to find the problems and needs of these people. I am pretty sure these people, which some of them still making contact to this day, would be a great asset for me throughout my career, during and even after my PhD program.
