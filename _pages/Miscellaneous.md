## Exchange Semester at RWTH Aachen University

In the Spring semester of 2023, I had the opportunity to study as an exchange student at RWTH Aachen University. This experience significantly impacted my career, not only in terms of academics and research but also by broadening my cultural understanding, improving my English proficiency, and giving me a taste of living abroad.

### Academic Experience

At RWTH Aachen, I took three master's-level courses: Nonlinear Control, Model-Based Estimation Methods, and Reinforcement Learning & Learning-Based Control. Due to differing academic schedules between Germany and Korea, I completed exams for the first two courses, achieving 1.0 in both. This boosted my confidence in my academic competitiveness, as earning such grades at a German institution is considered challenging. I was pleased to find that I could handle these courses with less effort than similar courses at SNU, which reassured me of my ability to thrive in international academic environments.

Through this experience, I gained clarity in my career direction. Through my studies, I recognized that while significant advancements have been made in both optimal and nonlinear control, these areas are highly developed and often theoretical. This led me to explore mechanism design, where I see more opportunities for innovation and practical applications. However, I remain deeply interested in control systems and how they can intersect with mechanical design to address complex engineering challenges.

### Research Experience

During my time at RWTH, I also had the chance to conduct research, applying Model Predictive Control (MPC) to an embedded system. This experience allowed me to present my research to foreign advisors, further developing my communication skills and gaining valuable feedback on my work.

### Cultural and Social Experience

In addition to my academic growth, my time at RWTH was a valuable cultural experience. I formed a close-knit group of international friends from Mexico, Austria, Turkey, Slovakia, and Ethiopia, and we met regularly at a local bar called *Kaktus* to share our experiences and cultures. We enjoyed activities like cooking traditional meals, going on day trips, and even introducing our families to one another. This deepened my understanding of different cultures and reinforced my belief that I can build strong, lasting friendships with people from diverse backgrounds, regardless of nationality or race.

I also took full advantage of events hosted by student associations such as AV, Incas, AEGEE, and TedX RWTH. These events allowed me to meet new friends from various backgrounds, some of whom Iâ€™ve maintained close relationships with.

### Travel and Broader Perspectives

Throughout my exchange semester, I traveled to 70 cities across 24 countries, meeting people from diverse backgrounds, including Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. These encounters broadened my perspective on different lifestyles and societal challenges. I focused much of my travels on the Balkans, where I found that travelers tend to be particularly open-minded and eager to connect. Meeting people from various walks of life has reinforced my belief that an engineer must understand the different needs and problems of people across cultures. I continue to keep in touch with many of the people I met, and they remain valuable connections that will enrich my career and personal growth.

### Personal Growth and Future Goals

This exchange semester reaffirmed my ability to adapt quickly to new environments, work alongside people from diverse backgrounds, and excel academically in a foreign language. These skills will be invaluable as I pursue a PhD abroad.

My experience in Germany also helped me realize the advantages of studying in regions like the U.S. or the EU, where there are abundant opportunities for collaboration between academia and industry. I saw that many students in Europe, particularly in Germany, gain practical experience through internships at prestigious companies, which complements the theoretical focus of their studies. In contrast, Korea excels in theoretical studies but offers fewer practical opportunities. Given my strong theoretical foundation, I believe that pursuing a PhD abroad, where I can gain more hands-on experience, is the next logical step in my career.

I documented my entire exchange experience in detail through Instagram, writing 510 daily posts over six months. This diary not only serves as a record of this pivotal time in my life but also as a source of reflection on how much I grew during this semester.
