- STEM is a Honor Society for SNU engineering students, standing for SNU Tomorrow's Edge Membership.
- Every year, between 20~30 students with superior academic performance and great will to contribute in engineering fields are allowed to join STEM.
- Most of the alumnis and even the current active members are now performing well and contributing a lot in various fields of academia and industry, many of them graduated or taking phd programs from top engineering institues in the US and Korea.
- With STEM members, we discuss various of engineering issues with each other and also participate in various events that can be held by a honor society.
- I regard communication between engineers of various fields really important, and also like to transfer opinions about research issues, or more broad issues like research ethics and the way engineers should develop.
- I really loved participating activities with STEM members, and made so many good friends inside this group.
- I've graduate STEM as an Honors Member for exceptional contributions as HR/PR Director and Chairman of SRT 2022.
