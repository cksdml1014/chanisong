 Sep 2021- Present
 Graduated as an Honors Member for exceptional contributions as HR/PR Director and Chairman of SRT 2022.

 50 delegates from 4 Asian countries. Led academic sessions and facilitated cultural exchanges.
 • Speaker, Tech Square Academic Seminar: Presented on power systems regarding environmental regulations (May
 2022) and Social Policy on Technology (Nov 2022).
 • Speaker, Vision Exhibition: Presented on automatic linkage mechanism design methodology (SBM) to over 100 fresh
men and sophomores (Feb 2024).
 • Major Snapshot: Authored three articles introducing major courses in the ME department, achieving a top-ranked
 Google search result for the keyword ’Mechanics’ in Korean with over 10,000 views.
 • Bi-Weekly Academic Seminars: Regularly discussed recent engineering issues in various fields

- STEM is a Honor Society for SNU engineering students, standing for SNU Tomorrow's Edge Membership.
- Every year, between 20~30 students with superior academic performance and great will to contribute in engineering fields are allowed to join STEM.
- Most of the alumnis and even the current active members are now performing well and contributing a lot in various fields of academia and industry, many of them graduated or taking phd programs from top engineering institues in the US and Korea.
- With STEM members, we discuss various of engineering issues with each other and also participate in various events that can be held by a honor society.
- I regard communication between engineers of various fields really important, and also like to transfer opinions about research issues, or more broad issues like research ethics and the way engineers should develop.
- I really loved participating activities with STEM members, and made so many good friends inside this group.
- I've graduate STEM as an Honors Member for exceptional contributions as HR/PR Director and Chairman of SRT 2022.
- Even after graduation, I am still participating in some STEM activities, to gain insights from the seminars, and to communicate with the members to understand the current flow of engineering and to search for ways to incorporate with my research.

## SRT

- SRT is the activity that I have strong attraction and devoted a lot of work and love to it.
- SRT, which stands for Student Round Table is a huge event between about 50 college students from 4 Asian countries (Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia) to discuss currently significant international problems that these countries should resovle and think of various ways for these countries to unite and incorporate with each other.
- Each year, STEM members participate in SRT, representing the team Korea.
- Every year, each countries take turns to host the event, which has to prepare the conference along with preparing extra events so that the members can get to know each other, to understand the cultural difference and become good friends.
- I took the charge of becoming the chairman of SRT 2022, which was hosted in Korea.
- Due to Covid, SRT 2020 and 2021 was held online, and SRT 2022 was also planned to held online.
- Since the Covid era was drastical to both SRT and STEM activity, it was both really hard but to important to encourage other members to participate and plan for this event, which was really hard due to the reason that it would be held as an online event.
- I tried to make this event as special and intimate as possible, came up and executed various ideas: 2-day Internal workshop with SRT Korean members to get closer to each other, opening up small zoom events 2 months before the SRT, opening specialized Slack for SRT members and hosting regular events to describe each other and writing comments to them, Sending Korean snacks to other countries by post so they can participate in food sharing event, gathering handwritings from each countries via online, and assemblying them to make a speicalized SRT bag and sending them as a gift, with handwritten postcard with them.
- It turned out with great results: most of the members, either from Korea or abroad, were very touched by this event, many crying when it ended.
- We could had in depth conference about four big topics: environment, techonology, covid regulation, and ???.
- We made good cultural exchange by sharing the pre-made Vlogs of our lives in our home university, and through language sharing event we can get not only basic knowledge of each others language, but also the culture behind it.
- Food sharing was a super succeed, everyone was so thankful to receive Korean food from overseas, and they loved the food so much. We chat a lot through the food sharing event, promising that we'll meet the others soon.
- At the end of the event, I've received a heartwarming rolling paper from all of the parcitipants and I felt so happy to organize such an event. This is also one of the moment that I decided to become a professor. I love to give love and good memories to others, and also love to see them being happy with it.
- After the event, I could still have close interaction with SRT members from other countries: we chat about our careers, future, and also give helps to each other: like filming videos that could encourage other students to joint the SRT club of their countries. We've also received other snacks and handwritings from the other countries as a sign of thank you.
- I've actually met some delegates and it was such a wholesome moment for me. I met Iori from SRT Japan at Cologne, Germany where she came from Oslo where she stayed for exchange semester to visit me when I was at exchange semester too. Seungwee from SRT Taiwan also came to Seoul the year after. I really enjoyed our times together, to hear their stories and what they'd gonna do in the future, also feeling happy that they are all curious about my story too.
- I could grow in various areas through organizing and operating this event, and Enlgish is also one huge thing. Before this event, there weren't so much chances to communicate using English. Through SRT, I could gain a lot of confidence and experience of using English. Of course many other aspects like leadership, controlling conflicts between members, planning and organizing events from zero base with controlling various aspects, how to play it by ear when sudden inicidents occur, and just so many more.
- It influenced STEM a lot too. STEM's members were not intimate with each other after 2 years of Covid, and many of the activities was not energetic at all. After SRT, the STEM members who participated in SRT made more energy to the whole STEM, encouraging other members to joint more activities, and they became the executive members, including myself, which led STEM become much activative club and to communicate a lot with each other. 

## PR

- I've worked as a chair of department of Public Relation department and led the department members with organizing various activities.
- I've organized and operated academic session with GLEAP, which is a honor scoeity for SNU natural science. It was interesting to study different approaches that science and math majors take and the different points that they consider important in their research, for example like fields in optimization and deep learning.
- Since most members and alumins of GLEAP are also performing well and contributing a lot in various fields of academia, the seminars they present was interesting and high-quaility.
- I've gathered seminar topics and give feedback to STEM members based on their materials, because it should be understable to non-engineers.
- I've also came out with an new idea of making pre-gorup meeting, ice-breaking and intermission time to make chances for STEM members and GLEAP members to get closer. This also considered that participating several seminars in a row wouldn't be recommended.
- Another big event that I've organized was sports day with SENS and gongsang, which are other clubs in SNU college of engineering both targeting education based volunteer works for high school students, and composed of mostly freshman and sophomores.
- Through this event, I wanted to make it as a good opportunity to meet younger students, since we can be a good mentor for them. The event also worked out well, and many of the SENS and gongsang members later joined STEM too.
- Another big reponsibility of Public Relation chair was as a executive of STEM, to operate the STEM and find ways for STEM to make more comfortable space for members to be friends and talk freely about engineering and other issues. After covid, reviving this mood was difficult but crucial, and the executives met bi-weekly to talk about how we should progress and what programs to operate to make this honor society a better organization. We really talke a lot through the meeting, lasting 3 hours and more, sometimes resulting in serious conflicts. But overcoming the conflicts and through those process, we were able to revive the mood and members became enthusiastic to STEM activities.
