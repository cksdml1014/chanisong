## Overview of STEM

- STEM (SNU Tomorrow's Edge Membership) is an honor society for Seoul National University engineering students.
- Membership is limited to 20-30 top-performing students annually, with alumni pursuing PhDs and contributing to academia and industry worldwide.
- As a member, I engaged in collaborative discussions on engineering issues, research ethics, and the societal role of engineers. These experiences helped me grow as both an engineer and a leader.
