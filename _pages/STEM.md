STEM (SNU Tomorrow's Edge Membership) is an honor society for Seoul National University engineering students. Each year, 20-30 students with outstanding academic performance and a strong commitment to advancing the field of engineering are invited to join. Many STEM alumni are now making significant contributions in academia and industry, with many pursuing or completing PhDs at top engineering institutions in Korea and abroad, including the U.S.

With STEM members, I’ve had the opportunity to discuss various engineering issues, participate in meaningful activities, and foster a community of collaboration. I believe communication between engineers from different fields is vital, and I enjoy exchanging ideas not only on research but also on broader topics such as research ethics and the role of engineers in society. STEM has been a deeply enriching experience, where I’ve made valuable friendships and had the chance to grow as both an engineer and a leader.

I graduated from STEM as an Honors Member, recognized for my significant contributions, including my role as HR/PR Director and Chairman of SRT 2022. Even after graduation, I continue to participate in STEM activities, attending seminars to gain insights and stay connected with current trends in engineering.

## SRT (Student Round Table)

SRT is one of the activities I am most passionate about. It is an annual event that brings together around 50 university students from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Mongolia to discuss critical international issues affecting these countries. The goal is to foster understanding and cooperation among future leaders from different cultures.

As Chairman of SRT 2022, which was hosted by Korea, I faced the challenge of organizing an event in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to restrictions, the event had to be held online, but I worked hard to make it as special and engaging as possible. Some initiatives I introduced included:
- A two-day internal workshop with SRT Korean members to build stronger connections before the event.
- Regular Zoom meetings two months prior to the event to foster interaction among participants.
- Specialized Slack channels for discussions and small events, allowing members to communicate regularly.
- Sending Korean snacks by post to international participants for a food-sharing event.
- Collecting handwritten notes from all countries and assembling them into a special SRT bag, which was sent to participants along with personalized postcards.

The result was a touching and memorable event. Participants from all countries expressed their appreciation, many even shedding tears at the conclusion. We held in-depth discussions on four major topics—environment, technology, COVID-19 regulations, and [insert fourth topic]—and engaged in cultural exchanges through pre-recorded vlogs and language-sharing activities. The food-sharing event, in particular, was a huge success, with everyone enjoying Korean snacks together.

After SRT, I maintained close connections with members from other countries. We’ve continued to share our career aspirations, offer support, and even collaborate on initiatives such as videos encouraging others to join SRT. I’ve met several delegates in person, including Iori from Japan, who was studying in Norway at the time. She traveled to visit me in Germany during my exchange semester. Seungwee from Taiwan also visited me in Seoul the following year.

SRT was a transformative experience for me, enhancing my leadership, conflict resolution, event organization, and English communication skills. It also played a pivotal role in my decision to become a professor, as I found great joy in organizing events that brought happiness and meaningful experiences to others.

## HR/PR Director

As HR/PR Director for STEM, I led several key initiatives, including organizing events and fostering connections between members. One of my proudest achievements was the joint academic session with GLEAP (the Honor Society for SNU Natural Sciences). This collaboration allowed engineering students to engage with science and math students, providing a unique opportunity to compare approaches and perspectives in fields such as optimization and deep learning.

To encourage interaction among STEM and GLEAP members, I implemented pre-group meetings, icebreaker activities, and intermission breaks during the seminars. This helped foster a closer-knit community and allowed participants to better absorb the high-level material presented.

I also organized a Sports Day event with SENS and Gongsang, two other volunteer organizations at SNU’s College of Engineering. This event provided an opportunity for younger students to meet potential mentors, and many of the participants later joined STEM.

In my role as HR/PR Director, I also worked closely with the STEM executive team to improve the organization’s culture post-COVID. We met bi-weekly to discuss strategies for increasing member engagement and revitalizing STEM’s activities. These meetings were often long and challenging, but they were essential in fostering a more enthusiastic and supportive environment within the organization.

## Academic Seminars

One of my favorite aspects of STEM is the bi-weekly academic seminars, where members present their research on topics ranging from soft robotics to nuclear fusion. These seminars offer a valuable opportunity to stay informed about cutting-edge developments across various fields of engineering.

In addition to student-led seminars, STEM invites alumni who are now pursuing PhDs, working as professors, or contributing to industry, to share their experiences and research. These sessions have exposed me to advancements in fields such as artificial intelligence, soft-robotics, and data science. Engaging with these alumni has provided invaluable insights into potential career paths and the evolving landscape of engineering research.

Even after graduating as an Honors Member, I continue to participate in these seminars, which allow me to stay engaged with ongoing research and contribute to discussions on emerging technologies.

## Tech Square

Tech Square is one of the core activities in STEM, where members participate in in-depth discussions on major topics of interest. Each participant conducts research on a subtopic and shares their insights with the group. I participated in Tech Square twice, presenting on:
- **Sustainable Cities:** I discussed the future of engine technology for automobiles and aerial vehicles, as well as the policies related to engineering for sustainability.
- **Future Technologies:** I contributed to discussions on cutting-edge innovations and their potential impact on society.

Tech Square allowed me to broaden my knowledge beyond my own research and engage in meaningful dialogue with members from different fields. It was an excellent opportunity to fuse ideas and expand my perspective on engineering’s role in addressing global challenges.

## Vision Exhibition

During my junior and senior years, I recognized the importance of mentoring younger students, especially freshmen and sophomores who may feel uncertain about their academic paths. Through STEM’s Vision Exhibition, I delivered a presentation to over 100 students, introducing them to Mechanism Design Automation Technology—a field unfamiliar to many students and even researchers.

I emphasized the potential of this technology and encouraged students to explore the vast opportunities available in engineering. I also shared my experiences as an exchange student at RWTH Aachen University and as a researcher at the startup **IDeAOcean**, providing them with insights into both academic and industry careers.

## Major Snapshot and STEMentor

In addition to my work with SENS, where I mentored high school students on engineering majors, I also contributed to STEMentor, a website created by STEM members to provide accessible articles about engineering. This platform has garnered over 1.6 million views and serves as an invaluable resource for high school students seeking information about different engineering disciplines.

I initiated the "Major Snapshot" program, where members of STEM write detailed articles about their major courses in a way that high school students can easily understand. I contributed three articles, including the widely-read "4 Major Mechanics," which received over 17,000 views and became the top Google search result for "4대역학" (Four Major Mechanics). My articles on robotics and mechanics & design have also helped students better understand mechanical engineering.

Today, Major Snapshot includes over 110 articles, and I continue to provide feedback to new contributors, helping them refine their articles to make them more accessible to younger students.

## Sports and Community

Beyond academic activities, I’ve enjoyed spending time with STEM members through sports and other social events. One memorable achievement was winning 2nd place in the SNU engineering futsal competition, where I played as goalkeeper. We also participated in marathons, kayaking, and swimming lessons together, strengthening our bonds as a community.
