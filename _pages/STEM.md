- STEM is a Honor Society for SNU engineering students, standing for SNU Tomorrow's Edge Membership.
- Every year, between 20~30 students with superior academic performance and great will to contribute in engineering fields are allowed to join STEM.
- Most of the alumnis and even the current active members are now performing well and contributing a lot in various fields of academia and industry, many of them graduated or taking phd programs from top engineering institues in the US and Korea.
- With STEM members, we discuss various of engineering issues with each other and also participate in various events that can be held by a honor society.
- I regard communication between engineers of various fields really important, and also like to transfer opinions about research issues, or more broad issues like research ethics and the way engineers should develop.
- I really loved participating activities with STEM members, and made so many good friends inside this group.
- I've graduate STEM as an Honors Member for exceptional contributions as HR/PR Director and Chairman of SRT 2022.
- Even after graduation, I am still participating in some STEM activities, to gain insights from the seminars, and to communicate with the members to understand the current flow of engineering and to search for ways to incorporate with my research.

## SRT

- SRT is the activity that I have strong attraction and devoted a lot of work and love to it.
- SRT, which stands for Student Round Table is a huge event between about 50 college students from 4 Asian countries (Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia) to discuss currently significant international problems that these countries should resovle and think of various ways for these countries to unite and incorporate with each other.
- Each year, STEM members participate in SRT, representing the team Korea.
- Every year, each countries take turns to host the event, which has to prepare the conference along with preparing extra events so that the members can get to know each other, to understand the cultural difference and become good friends.
- I took the charge of becoming the chairman of SRT 2022, which was hosted in Korea.
- Due to Covid, SRT 2020 and 2021 was held online, and SRT 2022 was also planned to held online.
- Since the Covid era was drastical to both SRT and STEM activity, it was both really hard but to important to encourage other members to participate and plan for this event, which was really hard due to the reason that it would be held as an online event.
- I tried to make this event as special and intimate as possible, came up and executed various ideas: 2-day Internal workshop with SRT Korean members to get closer to each other, opening up small zoom events 2 months before the SRT, opening specialized Slack for SRT members and hosting regular events to describe each other and writing comments to them, Sending Korean snacks to other countries by post so they can participate in food sharing event, gathering handwritings from each countries via online, and assemblying them to make a speicalized SRT bag and sending them as a gift, with handwritten postcard with them.
