## Overview of STEM

- STEM (SNU Tomorrow's Edge Membership) is an honor society for Seoul National University engineering students.
- Membership is limited to 20-30 top-performing students annually, with alumni pursuing PhDs and contributing to academia and industry worldwide.
- As a member, I engaged in collaborative discussions on engineering issues, research ethics, and the societal role of engineers. These experiences helped me grow as both an engineer and a leader.

## SRT (Student Round Table)

- **Role:** Chairman of SRT 2022, a major international conference with 50 participants from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Mongolia.
- **Activities:** 
  - Organized the event during the COVID-19 pandemic, transforming it into a successful online experience.
  - Implemented pre-event workshops, regular Zoom meetings, and interactive Slack channels for collaboration.
  - Introduced cultural exchange activities, including sending Korean snacks and handwritten postcards to participants abroad.
- **Impact:** 
  - Enhanced my leadership, event organization, and English communication skills.
  - Built close international connections, including in-person meetups with delegates during my exchange semester in Germany.
  - Led deep discussions on global topics (e.g., technology, COVID-19), leaving lasting impressions on participants.

## HR/PR Director

- **Role:** Director of HR/PR for STEM.
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Led a successful joint academic session with GLEAP (SNU Natural Sciences Honor Society), facilitating collaboration between STEM and natural science students.
  - Organized a Sports Day event with SENS and Gongsang, creating mentorship opportunities for younger students.
- **Executive Meetings:** 
  - Played a crucial role in shaping post-COVID STEM culture by organizing bi-weekly executive meetings to increase member engagement and collaboration.

## Academic Seminars

- Participated in Bi-weekly research presentations on cutting-edge engineering topics such as soft robotics and nuclear fusion.
- Some seminars Engage alumnis now working in academia and industry, gaining insights into AI, robotics, and other emerging fields.

## Tech Square

- **Overview:** Tech Square is a core STEM activity where engineers from various fields combine their expertise to discuss major engineering topics.
- Participated twice, presenting on:
  - **Sustainable Cities:** Future of engine technology for automobiles and aerial vehicles, and engineering policies for sustainability.
  - **Future Technologies:** Cutting-edge innovations and their societal impact.
- **Impact:** Tech Square broadened my understanding beyond my own field of study, allowing me to engage in discussions that enhanced my perspective on engineering's role in addressing global challenges.

## Vision Exhibition

- **Audience:** Presented to over 100 SNU freshmen and sophomores in the College of Engineering.
- **Presentation:** Introduced Mechanism Design Automation Technology and shared insights from my exchange at RWTH Aachen University and my research at **IDeAOcean**.
- **Impact:** Helped younger students navigate academic and career paths in engineering.

## Major Snapshot and STEMentor

- **Contribution:** Initiated the "Major Snapshot" program on **[STEMentor](https://stementor.tistory.com/)**, providing accessible articles on engineering majors.
- **Popular Articles:** 
  - "4 Major Mechanics" with over 17,000 views, reaching the top Google search result for "4대역학."
  - Other articles on robotics and mechanical design have collectively garnered over 22,000 views.
- **Impact:** Helped high school students better understand engineering disciplines and prepare for their academic futures.

## Sports and Community

- **Key Achievement:** Played as goalkeeper and secured 2nd place in the SNU engineering futsal competition.
- **Other Activities:** Engaged in marathons, kayaking, and swimming with STEM members, fostering a strong sense of community and teamwork.
