- In this research, we developed **a new methodology of automatic linkage mechanism design** when there's **an obstacle inside the feasible design area**.  
- We've revised the *SBM model* by adding additional constraints that make the mechanism avoid the obstacle.  
- With this methodology, we can automatically design both the topology and the shape of the linkage mechanism that works safely in environments where there are obstacles.
