While most of the Mechanism Design Automation Technology has developed through mechanisms constrained in 2D Space, many real-world problems require the design of 3D Mechanisms.

In this research, we have proposed a novel methodology for automatic 3D linkage mechanism design: **3D JBM**.

3D JBM enables the automatic linkage mechanism design containing Spherical / Revolute / Prismatic joints.

Through cooperation with Hyundai Motors, we've designed a novel rear-wing mechanism using 3D JBM.

Some research results are constrained to disclose at the moment due to project regulations.
